# Real-Time-Emotion-Detection

## Overview  
This project implements a real-time emotion detection system using a webcam. The system detects faces in the live video feed and predicts emotions based on the facial expressions using a pre-trained TensorFlow model. The detected emotions are displayed on the video output.

## Requirements  
Ensure you have the following packages installed:  
- Python 3.x  
- TensorFlow  
- Keras  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- tqdm

## CNN Image Classification   
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is designed to classify images into different categories based on learned features from a provided dataset. It leverages various libraries for data preprocessing, model construction, and training.  

## Emotion Labels
The following emotions are recognized by the model:

  - Angry
  - Disgusted
  - Fearful
  - Happy
  - Neutral
  - Sad
  - Surprised
